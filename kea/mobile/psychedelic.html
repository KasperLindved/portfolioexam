<p>
The psychedelic style was introduced in the late 60’s, and was used broadly throughout the 70’s as well. The psychedelic style is very unlikely from earlier styles in the 1900’s, making it very untraditional. However, the psychedelic has some origins from the Art Nouveau, characterized by the romantic and very natural way of expression. Featured characteristics often include psychedelic and euphoric elements, as a visualization of the effects of drugs, such as LSD.

<p>Psychedelic drugs was widely used among the so called “baby boomers”, the generation born after World War 2, when the birth rate increased massively. During the 60´s, this generation entered its teenage years, causing a historic youth revolution. A new pacifistic lifestyle, inspired by Buddhism, became the ideology of the Flower Power movement, and gave birth to the classic “hippie”. During that time, it became fashionable to rebel against the usual norms, in every part of society. The psychedelic style was used visually and audibly in music, art, fashion etc. This led to an era, that has inspired memorable artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Janis Joplin, who are still praised today</p>
