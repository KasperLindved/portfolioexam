So the font in the menubar (gates, fences etcc.) is in Helvetica on this prototype, but should be in Sinhala Sangam NM in a bold type. It just couldnt get very bold in XD so i just put in helvetica instead as a temporary option



These codes make sure that on wider screens, the 4 main images/buttons stay in one line and resize themselves according to the width of the viewport, while on mobile screens these will stack on top of each other, and they almost fill the screen width so that users can easily click on them while using a phone.
