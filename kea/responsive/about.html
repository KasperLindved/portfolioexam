	<p>I am a 21 year old, Danish designer, currently studying Multimedia Design at Copenhagen School of Design</p>

		<p>I have always been very fond of the creative way of thinking. Doing things differently, and expressing feelings
		and thoughts visually and audibly. I've been doodling since I can remember, however only when utterly bored.
		I began playing the piano at 10 and guitar at 13. That was the time, I truly felt that being creative was my thing.
		Not only because I enjoyed it, but because I felt it came naturally. Later I became very enthusiastic with making
		short films, and playing around with visual effects. That made me choose a cinematics course in high school,
		and I absolutely loved it. I loved every aspect of producing an artwork, and showcase it to an audience and
		recieve the feedback and criticism.</p>
</div>
		<p>I took two years off after high school, and this free time helped me a lot to figure out, what I really wanted to do.
		Initially, I thought about appyling to the Copenhagen Film School, and was supposed to start after my first year off.
		However, as I began drawing for a local caf√©, I realized that I didn't want to specify my creative skills to much.
		I want to make movies as much as I want to draw on blackboards and walls, make music and webdesign.
		This is where KEA (Copenhagen School of Design) came in the picture, as they have a Multimedia Designer course.
		Despite the fact, that I've only been here for 3 weeks as I write this, I honestly feel that it's a perfect choice.

        Design-wise, I really dig the old-fashioned jazzy style and Art Deco. Nevertheless, I also have a very urban style, inspired by todays Hip Hop culture. </p>
